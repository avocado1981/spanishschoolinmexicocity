Spanish language school in mexico city

Recently we had to the chance of taking a Spanish course in Mexico City at a local Spanish school named Walk Spanish. We did some school shopping of course before selecting this language school and we must say we were more than happy to choose this option for ur language studies! The school offers Spanish language courses in an outside of the classroom environment which means in cafeterias, museums, parks and more in the top neighborboods such as Polanco, Roma and Condesa. 
### This [Mexico City Spanish Language School](https://www.walkspanish.com) has, in our opinion, revolutionized the Spanish language learning methodology. 
Some pictures of our teachers and stuents below.
